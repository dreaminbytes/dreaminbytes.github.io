# Dream-In-Bytes: Software Developer

Crafting elegant solutions through code with 20+ years of experience in building robust, user-centered applications.

## About Me

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong background in full-stack development. After earning my Computer Science degree from Tech University, I've spent the last 5+ years building applications that solve real-world problems while maintaining clean, efficient code.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, mentoring junior developers, or exploring new technologies. I believe in continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible through software.
